# AirPassengers
This project was made using the R language and is a forecast project. We used the inbuild R dataset "AirPassengers". It is a timeseries that presents the number of Air Passengers per month for 1949 to 1960. We analyze the data, and attempt to make a forecast for the next 10 years after the actual data.
